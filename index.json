With more than 50 papers related to NeRFs in the CVPR 2022, it is one of the most influential papers of all time.\nNeural fields A neural field is a neural network that parametrizes a signal. In our case, this signal is either a single 3D scene or an object. It is important to note that a single network needs to be trained to encode (capture) a single scene. It is worth mentioning that, unlike standard machine learning, the objective is to overfit the neural network to a particular scene. Essentially, neural fields embed the scene into the weights of the network.\n3D scenes are usually stored in computer graphics using voxel grids or polygon meshes. However, voxels are costly to store and polygon meshes are limited to hard surfaces. Neural fields are gaining popularity as they are efficient and compact representations of objects or scenes that are differentiable, continuous, and can have arbitrary dimensions and resolutions. Neural radiance fields are a special case of Neural fields that solve the view synthesis problem.\nNeural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/nerf_intro/","summary":"Imagine being able to generate photorealistic 3D models of objects and scenes that can be viewed from any angle, with details so realistic that they are indistinguishable from reality.
